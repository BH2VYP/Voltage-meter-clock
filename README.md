Voltage meter clock
1. Use three 85C1 voltmeters with a maximum range of 20V for modification, and replace the 2.7K resistor. You can also purchase a maximum 3V voltmeter without modification, but the size of the meter has changed and cannot hit the 3D printed casing.
2. Adopting ESP32 controller, pins 2, 4, and 5 are connected to the hour, minute, and second voltmeters for output. Use the Python software to change the WiFi name and password in the program and connect to your own wireless network.
3. Using 2 18650 batteries and a 5V charging module (module size is 20 * 25mm)
4. If the size of the designed shell is too large, it can be divided and printed by oneself.
5. 4 M2 * 6 screws are required to secure the back cover.
6. 12 3*4mm strong magnets are required to be installed on the base.
